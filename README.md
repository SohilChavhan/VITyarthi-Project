# 📚 Library Management System

> A Python-based desktop application for streamlined book inventory and circulation management.

## 📖 Overview
The **Library Management System** is a desktop application designed to digitize the administrative workflows of a library. Built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, it replaces manual record-keeping with an automated interface.

The system allows librarians to efficiently **Add**, **View**, **Issue**, and **Return** books. It features a dynamic inventory system that automatically categorizes books by genre and updates availability status in real-time, eliminating human error and data redundancy.
