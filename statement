Problem Statement

Traditional library management often relies on manual record-keeping using physical ledgers or disparate spreadsheets.Searching for a specific book or checking its availability status manually takes a lot of time. This manual method makes the system very prone to mistakes which leads to books being lost.
This project solves this problem by reducing the manual labour of keeping records by using a digital interface which makes the entire process of adding, viewing, issuing and returning books.

Scope of the Project

This project can be further expanded to be used in bigger organizations to manage and keep track of their data. The current version focuses on administrative backend operations (staff-facing) rather than a public-facing catalog for students/members. 
The scope of this project is to make it accessible for the customer as well so that issuing and returning a book becomes less cumbersome.

Inventory Management (Keeping Track of Stuff)
Cataloging: This is just logging the books. We type in the details—like the title, who wrote it, and what genre it is—so the computer knows what we actually have.
Database Integrity: This stops us from adding the same book twice. Everything gets its own specific ID, so the system doesn't get confused about how many copies we have.
Status Tracking: This part is a lifesaver. It updates the status of the book automatically. It tells us if it's sitting on the shelf or if someone checked it out, so we don't have to actually walk over and look for it.
Here is the "Operational Scope" section rewritten in those same two styles.
Option 1: The "Class Project Report" Tone
Professional enough for a grade, but simple enough to be clear.
Operational Scope (How it Works)
Admin Access Only: This system is designed just for the library staff, like the librarians or admins. We didn't build a login for students in this version, so they can't access it remotely to reserve books from home yet.
Saving Data: The system makes sure that all the records—like book lists and who borrowed what—are actually saved. This way, when you close the program, the data doesn't just disappear; it’s still there when you open it again.



Who uses it and how?
Just for the Librarian: Basically, this is for internal use only. We didn't make a user side for this, so random students can't log in or reserve stuff online. It's just for the admin to manage things at the desk.
Assumptions and Constraints 
Financial Management: This version does not calculate late fees or fines for overdue books.
User Account Management: The system does not currently register students/members with passwords; it likely uses just a name or ID to issue the book.
Barcode Integration: Data entry is manual rather than automated via barcode scanners.



Targeted Users 

The primary daily users of the system are librarians. They utilize the software to issue books to members, process returns, and check the immediate availability of titles requested by visitors. 


High-Level Features

1.Dynamic Inventory Management (Add Books) The system allows users to input book titles and assign them to predefined genres. The application includes validation logic to prevent empty entries or duplicate book submissions, ensuring database integrity.
2.Categorized Data Visualization (View Library) Unlike simple list views, this feature dynamically generates a visual grid of the inventory. It groups books by their genre, allowing the librarian to see the distribution of the collection (e.g., "How many Thrillers do we have?") at a glance.
3.Multi-Select Issuance System To speed up the checkout process, the "Issue" feature supports multi-selection. The librarian can select multiple books from different genres simultaneously and issue them in a single transaction. The system immediately updates the status of these books to "Issued," preventing concurrent borrowing.
4.Smart Return Processing The "Return" feature tracks the original genre of borrowed books. When a book is returned, the system parses the data (separating the Title from the Genre) and automatically sorts the book back into its correct alphabetical position within its specific genre category.
